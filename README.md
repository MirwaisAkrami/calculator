## CSS Styling
We can style HTML elements in four ways

- Through element specific attributes like width and height.
- Using inline css through `style` attribute.
- Putting all CSS in the `style` element of `head` element.
- Importing styles from a .css file.

## HTML DIV tag
- div element is used to make divisions in html page, this makes it easy to style and make html element.


## FORM inputs

- INPUT is used to get the user input either from keyboard or mouse, examples: text, number, checkbox, radio, file etc.
- `margin: auto`  sets the element in the center of it's parent.
- Try to use `%` in the measurings in the CSS, it helps with responsive UI.
